## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) - JS State Management Library
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - Motion library for React.

### What I learned

- I practiced state management using Redux Toolkit.
- I got an understanding of how traditional game AIs work and implemented an AI for the Player Vs Computer mode.

### Continued development

I am planning to build a backed server to allow players to play from different devices.
